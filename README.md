# topic-detection

A simple topic detection module, based on Wordnet Domains data

## API

### new TopicDetection()

A basic constructor

### detector.topics(text)

Returns a list of topics with normalized scores. There isn't a reliable order
as JavaScript doesn't allow that, so you'll need to sort by score yourself to
get the top scored topic.

    var TopicDetection = require('topic-detection');
    var detector = new TopicDetection();
    var scores = detector.topics(myText);
